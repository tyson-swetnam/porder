[Orders v2](https://developers.planet.com/docs/orders/) is the next iteration of Planet's API for getting Analysis Ready Data (ARD) delivered to you. Orders v2 has the capability to submit any number of images in a batch order and perform operations such as: top of atmospheric (TOA) reflectance, compression, coregistration, and supports enhanced notifications such as email and webhooks. Based on your personal license access you can use the `porder` to place orders, download orders, or chain together a sequence of operations from the Orders v2 API. The `porder` tool runs on the command line interface only. For exporting to cloud storage `porder` uses a configuration folder with `config.yml` structures.

## Prerequisites

You must have native python & pip installed. You can test this by going to the terminal (or windows command prompt) and trying.

```python --version``` and then ```pip list```

If you have no errors and you have Python `3.6+` or higher you should be good to go.

We also recommend installation within virtual environment. If you use [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)

```
$ conda create -n planet_orders python
$ conda activate planet_orders
```

**The `porder` tool is dependent on `shapely` and `fiona` which depend on GDAL**

[QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) is a useful open-source GIS platform which includes all of the major required dependencies for running `porder`. Installation of QGIS will ensure all `porder` requirements are met.

### Linux

Installing Python GDAL in Ubuntu

```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa && sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev python3-gdal
```

### Windows

We also recommend using [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and following the linux instructions.

For Windows this [guide](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:UZWc-pnCgwsJ:https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/tutorials/installing-gdal-for-windows+&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) from UCLA is useful.


### MacOS X

[KyngChaos](https://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks/) maintains a MacOS X installation for GDAL

Install GDAL using [brew]

Install brew:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Install GDAL:
```
% brew install gdal --HEAD
% brew install gdal
% gdal-config --version
```

Install GDAL Python binding:

```
% pip3 install —-upgrade pip
% pip3 install numpy
% python3 -c ‘import gdal; print(gdal.VersionInfo())’
```

### Docker

You can also run `porder` with [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/tswetnam/porder)

```
$ docker pull tswetnam/porder:latest
```

If you haven't run `planet init` to create your token, do so first. Make sure to run docker with the volume flag mounted back to your home `${HOME}` or current working directory `${PWD}`:

```
$ docker run -it --rm -v ${HOME}:/root tswetnam/porder:latest planet init
```

check if you now have a private `.planet.json` file in your home or current working directory.

Run `porder` as a test:

```
$ docker run -it --rm -v ${HOME}:/root tswetnam/porder:latest porder quota
```

This should return your user information and the remaining available km of data:

```
Subscription ID: XXXXX
Plan ID: XXXXX
Allocation Name: your@email.address
Allocation active from: YEAR-MM-DD
Quota Enabled: True
Total Quota in SqKm: 10000
Total Quota used: 0.0
Remaining Quota in SqKm: 10000.0
```

## Installing porder

Once you have the dependency libraries configured you're ready to install

From `pip`:

```pip install porder```

For linux it might help to specify the pip type and use `--user`

```
pip3 install porder --user
```

From GitHub `source`:

```
git clone https://github.com/tyson-swetnam/porder.git
cd porder
python setup.py install
```

Type `porder -h` to view the help

## Windows Setup

Shapely and a few other libraries are notoriously difficult to install on windows machines so follow the steps mentioned here **before installing porder**. You can download and install shapely and other libraries from the [Unofficial Wheel files from here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) download depending on the python version you have. **Do this only once you have install GDAL**. I would recommend the steps mentioned above to get the GDAL properly installed. However I am including instructions to using a precompiled version of GDAL similar to the other libraries on windows. You can test to see if you have gdal by simply running

```gdalinfo```

in your command prompt. If you get a read out and not an error message you are good to go. If you don't have gdal try Option 1,2 or 3 in that order and that will install gdal along with the other libraries

#### Option 1:
Starting from porder v0.4.5 onwards:

Simply run ```porder -h``` after installation. This should go fetch the extra libraries you need and install them. Once installation is complete, the porder help page will show up. This should save you from the few steps below.

#### Option 2:
If this does not work or you get an unexpected error try the following commands. You can also use these commands if you simply want to update these libraries.

```
pipwin refresh
pipwin install gdal
pipwin install pyproj
pipwin install shapely
pipwin install fiona
pipwin install geopandas
```

#### Option 3

For windows first thing you need to figure out is your Python version and whether it is 32 bit or 64 bit. You can do this by going to your command prompt and typing python.

![windows_cmd_python](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/63856293-3dfc2b80-c96f-11e9-978d-d2c1a01cfe36.PNG)

For my windows machine, I have both 32-bit python 2.7.16 and 64-bit Python 3.6.6. You can get the python version at the beginning of the highlighted lines and the 32 or 64 bit within the Intel or AMD64 within the square brackets. Your default python is the one you get by just typing python in the command line. Then download the following packages based on the information we collect about our python type in the earlier step. We use unofficial binaries to install these. This step is only needed if you are on a windows machine if you are using a setup manager like anaconda you **might** be able to avoid this setup completely

At this stage **if you were unable to install gdal then download the gdal binaries first**, install that before everything else

gdal: [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal)

Then follow along the following libraries
* pyproj: [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyproj](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyproj)
* shapely: [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely)
* fiona: [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona)
* geopandas: [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#geopandas](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#geopandas)

To choose the version that is correct for you use the python information you collected earlier
For example for my python 3.6.6 and AMD 64 if I was installing shapely I would choose the following, here 36 means python 3.6 and amd64 refers to the 64bit we were talking about.

```Shapely‑1.6.4.post2‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl```

You will get a wheel file or a file ending with .whl. You can now simply browse to the folder or migrate to it in your command prompt. Once there if I am installing for my python 3.6 the command was. At this point we will make use of our trusted package installer that comes with python called pip. Note the choice of pip or pip3 depends on your python version usually you can get the pip to use with your python by typing


```pip3 -V```

you get a readout like this

```pip 18.1 from c:\python3\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.6)```

if you have pip just replace that with ```pip -V```

Then simply install the wheel files you downloaded using the following setup

```
pip3 install full path to Shapely‑1.6.4.post2‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl

in my case that would be

pip3 install "C:\Users\samapriya\Downloads\Shapely‑1.6.4.post2‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl"
```

Or you can use [anaconda to install](https://conda-forge.github.io/). Again, both of these options are mentioned on [Shapely’s Official PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/).

## Getting started

Make sure you initialized planet client by typing ```planet init```. As usual, to print help:

![pmain](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/79036688-c0e99380-7b98-11ea-9625-ddd03d558a4f.png)

To obtain help for a specific functionality, simply call it with _help_ switch, e.g.: `porder idlist -h`. If you didn't install porder, then you can run it just by going to *porder* directory and running `python porder.py [arguments go here]`

## porder Simple CLI for Planet ordersv2 API
The tool is designed to simplify using the ordersv2 API and allows the user to chain together tools and operations for multiple item and asset types and perform these operations and download the assets locally.

### porder readme
Now open the readme webpage in your browser using

```
porder readme
```

### porder quota
Just a simple tool to print your planet subscription quota quickly.

![porder_quota](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53096751-d19afe00-34ed-11e9-9e10-b2c894800cbe.png)

### base64
This does exactly as it sounds, it encodes your credential files to base64 for use with gcs.

![porder_base64](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53096754-d495ee80-34ed-11e9-980d-418601bc975a.png)

### convert to geojson
This tool allows you to convert from a folder with multiple shapefiles or kml files to a folder with geojson that can then be used with the tool. It makes use of geopandas and reprojects your shapefile to make it compatible while passing onto the API for search and download. KML conversions are handled seperately.

![pconvert](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/79036707-f1313200-7b98-11ea-9c6b-19960d1c6923.png)

### simplify
This reduces the number of vertices for a multi vertex and complex GeoJSON. Extremely high vertex count (over 500) seem to fail and hence this tool allows you to export a new geojson with reduced vertices. It uses an implementation of the Visvalingam-Wyatt line simplification algorithm. This tool does work with and without Fiona, but Fiona installation is recommended.

![porder simplify](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/56763793-36ced200-6771-11e9-8b61-8f94b1f61152.png)

### idlist
Create an idlist for your geometry based on some basic filters,including geometry, start and end date and cloud cover. If no cloud cover is specified everything form 0 to 100% cloud cover is included. For now the tool can handle geojson,json and kml files. The output is a csv file with ids. The tool also allows you to make sure you get percentage overlap, when selecting image, for clip operations adjust it accordingly (usally --ovp 1 for orders not to fail during clip). The tool now also prints estimated area in Square kilometes for the download and estimated area if you clipped your area with the geometry you are searching (just estimates). You can now pass multiple assetswith the idlist tool pass assets as analytic_sr,udm2 for example to get items with both these assets ``` --asset analytic_sr,udm2.

**I have changed the setup to now do the following two things**

* The number option is optional, so it can look for all images in the time range, but be careful if the area is too large, _use at own risk_. A better option is to supply the number.

* It is possible to often forget about the different asset types, so you can now not pass an item and the script will return every possible type of asset for each item type depending on the bundle.

![porder_idlist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25802584/55653649-2e602880-57bd-11e9-9d43-3587d2021d6f.png)

A simple setup would be
![porder_idlist_setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53096128-6e5c9c00-34ec-11e9-9ddd-767f96d603b0.png)

To run an experiment to add additional filter, you can now pass an additional string or range filter or both flag for string and range filters, a setup would be. The additional filters are optional

```
porder idlist --input "Path to geojson file" --start "YYYY-MM-DD" --end "YYYY-MM-DD" --item "PSScene" --asset "analytic_sr_udm2" --outfile "Path to idlist.csv" --filters range:clear_percent:55:100 --number 20

porder idlist --input "Path to geojson file" --start "YYYY-MM-DD" --end "YYYY-MM-DD" --item "PSScene" --asset "analytic_sr_udm2" --outfile "Path to idlist.csv" --filters string:satellite_id:"1003,1006,1012,1020,1038" --number 20

porder idlist --input "Path to geojson file" --start "YYYY-MM-DD" --end "YYYY-MM-DD" --item "PSScene" --asset "analytic_sr_udm2" --outfile "Path to idlist.csv" --filters string:satellite_id:"1003,1006,1012,1020,1038" range:clear_percent:55:100 --number 20
```

The idlist tool can now use a multipolygon and iteratively look for scenes.

# Getting an idlist

Create an idlist for your geometry based on some basic filters,including geometry, start and end date and cloud cover. If no cloud cover is specified everything form 0 to 100% cloud cover is included. For now the tool can handle geojson,json and kml files. The output is a csv file with ids. The tool also allows you to make sure you get percentage overlap, when selecting image, for clip operations adjust it accordingly (usally --ovp 1 for orders not to fail during clip). The tool now also prints estimated area in Square kilometes for the download and estimated area if you clipped your area with the geometry you are searching (just estimates).

* It is possible to often forget about the different asset types, so you can now not pass an item and the script will return every possible type of asset for each item type depending on the bundle.

![porder_idlist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25802584/55653649-2e602880-57bd-11e9-9d43-3587d2021d6f.png)

A simple setup would be
![porder_idlist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/69602327-24f22d80-0fe5-11ea-8053-4de8c030ce26.gif)

To run an experiment to add additional filter, you can now pass an additional string or range filter or both flag for string and range filters, a setup would be. The additional filters are optional

<b>

```
porder idlist --input "Path to geojson file" --start "YYYY-MM-DD" --end "YYYY-MM-DD" --item "PSScene" --asset "analytic_sr_udm2" --outfile "Path to idlist.csv" --filters range:clear_percent:55:100 --number 20

porder idlist --input "Path to geojson file" --start "YYYY-MM-DD" --end "YYYY-MM-DD" --item "PSScene" --asset "analytic_sr_udm2" --outfile "Path to idlist.csv" --filters string:satellite_id:"1003,1006,1012,1020,1038" --number 20

porder idlist --input "Path to geojson file" --start "YYYY-MM-DD" --end "YYYY-MM-DD" --item "PSScene" --asset "analytic_sr_udm2" --outfile "Path to idlist.csv" --filters string:satellite_id:"1003,1006,1012,1020,1038" range:clear_percent:55:100 --number 20
```

</b>

The search tool now allows the user to pass Hours , Minutes and seconds and utilizes the local timezone on the users computer to search. This including the format HH:MM:SS seperated from yyyy-mm-dd by T. An example would be the following, while noting that passing time is purely optional and you can still search by simply passing YYYY-MM-DD.

```
porder idlist --input "Path to geojson file" --start "yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS" --end "yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS" --item "PSScene" --asset "analytic_sr_udm2" --outfile "Path to idlist.csv" --filters range:clear_percent:55:100 --number 20

porder idlist --input "Path to geojson file" --start "2021-01-01T14:12:10" --end "2021-03-01T16:20:20" --item "PSScene" --asset "analytic_sr_udm2" --outfile "Path to idlist.csv" --number 20
```

The idlist tool can now use a multipolygon and iteratively look for scenes.


### difflist
It is possible you already downloaded some images or metadata files, and your you want a difference idlist to create orders for only assets and item types you do not have. It takes in your local folder path, type image or metadata and some basic filters,including geometry, start and end date and cloud cover. If no cloud cover is specified everything form 0 to 100% cloud cover is included. For now the tool can handle geojson,json and kml files. The output is a csv file with ids.

![porder_difflist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25802584/54535868-dc6a7680-4965-11e9-8047-250c568f10e1.png)

A simple setup would be
![porder_diffcheck_setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53096408-14100b00-34ed-11e9-8ee1-8c49e8145aef.png)

or without the cloud filter

![porder_diffcheck_nocloud_setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53096598-8a147200-34ed-11e9-8583-8ceaa93da65d.png)

### idsplit
This allows you to split your idlist into small csv files incase you wanted to created batches of orders.

![porder_idsplit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25802584/54536155-877b3000-4966-11e9-9a32-9a4379eef0f7.png)

A simple setup would be
![porder_idsplit_setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53097536-b204d500-34ef-11e9-8a6c-e2d52986d90c.png)

### idcheck
It is possible for you to modify the idlist, add or remove ids. Once done, this tool allows you to estimate the total area of images and area that intersect with your geometry or area if clipped.

![porder_idcheck](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/57543905-c05ed200-7323-11e9-9afb-09613ffffd06.png)

A simple setup would be
![porder_idcheck_setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/57543933-d5d3fc00-7323-11e9-946f-200a4791f5e8.png)

### bundles
Ordering using ordersv2 uses the concept of bundles. A bundle is a combination of multiple assets for an item that come together and are delivered as part of the overall fulfillment of the order. For example an analytic asset for PSScene is a single tif file, however the analytic_sr_udm2 bundle for PSScene includes analytic tiff file, the analytic_xml metadata and the udm2 data mask file as part of the bundle. You can find more information about [bundles here](https://developers.planet.com/docs/orders/product-bundles-reference/). Thus the concept of bundles bring together single function to order and download multiple related assets. Since the list of bundles is long, this tool simply allows you to get every bundle type based on item type. The setup is simple

![porder_bundles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/61171622-48da3880-a548-11e9-829f-d8c71dc39ce5.png)

A simple setup would be

```
porder bundles --item "PSScene"
```

### order
This tool allows you to actually place the order using the idlist that you created earlier. the ```--op``` argument allows you to take operations, delivery and notifications in a sequence for example ```--op toar clip email``` performs Top of Atmospheric reflectance, followed by clipping to your geometry and send you an email notification once the order has completed, failed or had any any change of status. An important changes is the concept of passing bundles instead of using assets. Bundles are predefined meaning all assets in a bundle are not available for an item your attempt at downloading that attempt will fail.

For example if an item id '20181227_125554_0f4c' does not have surface reflectance asset type. So if you try to download this using bundle type analytic_sr_udm2 it will not work, similary if you order an item where a specific operation cannot be performed for example if you order visual and then try to do bandmath with four bands. These examples and more are where **fallback bundles** come in handy. Think of this as providing a list of bundles to keep trying if one bundle type fails. The priority goes left to right. You can provide comma seperated fallback bundles for example as

```analytic_sr_udm2,analytic``` instead of ```analytic_sr_udm2``` to avoid certain items from failing to download.

The list of operations for the ```--op``` are below and ** the order of these operations is important**

The same setup with delivery of each image, its metadata as a zip file would be. Note how we only added zip to the op list

![porder_clip_zip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/61171620-48da3880-a548-11e9-9c96-1d12ca762ca4.png)

A simple setup with **Google Earth Engine Delivery** and a few indices along with email notification would be

![porder_gee](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/105747304-3cd58200-5f06-11eb-8b50-b903035c4ad2.gif)

### reorder
This tool allows you to reorder an existing order with the same item ids and tools. This is trying to look into the overall structures of existing orders and maybe useful to reorder if an order fails for example.

```
usage: porder reorder [-h] --url URL [--notification NOTIFICATION]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Required named arguments.:
  --url URL             Order url to be ordered

Optional named arguments:
  --notification NOTIFICATION
                        Use "email" to get an email notification
```

### cancel
You can cancel a queued order or cancel all queued orders, before the status changes to running. Simply put you can cancel a specific order before it starts running or cancel all of your queued orders.

```
usage: porder cancel [-h] [--id ID]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --id ID     order id you want to cancel use "all" to cancel all
```

Setup to cancel an order

```
porder cancel --id "orderid goes here"
```

to cancel all queued orders

```
porder cancel --id "all"
```

### orderstate list
This tool allows you to get the list of orders based on the states and based on the start and end dates of orders. For example if you want to find out all orders that failed within the week you can use this tool to check that.

```
usage: porder ostate [-h] [--state STATE] [--start START] [--end END]
                     [--limit LIMIT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --state STATE  choose state between queued| running | success | failed |
                 partial
  --start START  start date in format YYYY-MM-DD
  --end END      end date in format YYYY-MM-DD

Optional named arguments:
  --limit LIMIT  Limit the maximum table size
```

The setup to check failed orders would be for example the following, You can place a limit on the number of orders to get by using --limit

```
porder ostate --state failed --start 2019-11-01 --end 2019-11-20
```


### ordersize
The tool now allows you to estimate the total download size for a specific order.

![porder_ordersize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53097620-e4163700-34ef-11e9-893b-73551d485c83.png)

An example setup look like the following

<center>

![ordersize](/images/ordersize.png)

</center>

### stats
The tool allows you to check on number of running and queued orders for both organization and user level. Using this is simple

```
porder stats
```

output should look like this:

```
Checking on all running orders...
Total queued order for organization: 0
Total running orders for organization: 1

Total queued orders for user: 0
Total running orders for user: 0
```

### download
The allows you to download the files in your order, to a local folder. It uses the order url generated using the orders tool to access and download the files.

![porder_download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53097694-11fb7b80-34f0-11e9-92bd-3b841ab8b3df.png)

### multipart download
The allows you to multipart download the files in your order, this uses a multiprocessing downloader to quickly download your files to a local folder. It uses the order url generated using the orders tool to access and download the files.

![porder_multipart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53097736-2b042c80-34f0-11e9-9724-68e9ed356ab7.png)

### multiprocessing download
The uses the multiprocessing library to quickly download your files to a local folder. It uses the order url generated using the orders tool to access and download the files and includes an expotential rate limiting function to handle too many requests. To save on time it uses an extension filter so for example if you are using the zip operation you can use ".zip" and if you are downloading only images, udm and xml you can use ".tif" or ".xml" accordingly. For python 3.4 or higher, this switches to using an true async downloader instead of using multiprocessing.

A simple setup would be
